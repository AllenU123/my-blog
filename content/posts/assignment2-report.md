## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Framework Chosen

For this assignment, I selected **Hugo**, a fast and flexible static site generator written in Go. I preferred Hugo over Sphinx because:

- It supports beautiful and customizable themes like PaperMod.
- Markdown-based content management is intuitive.
- Deployment to GitHub Pages is well-documented and straightforward.
- It allows me to easily organize content, blog posts, and navigation.
